## Software Engineer, Game Developer, and Tech Enthusiast.

I'm Ra'ad Aldakhil, a software engineer with an *MEng in Software Engineering* from The **University of Manchester**. My academic journey focused on gamification and machine learning, culminating in a thesis that integrated EEG technology with educational applications. At university, I co-founded the Game Development society, organizing industry workshops and a game jam sponsored by companies like Epic Games and GameMaker.

Currently, I work as a *Site Reliability Engineer* at **Saudi Aramco**, where I've automated departmental processes, developed automation solutions for storage services, architected and maintained multi-petabyte storage infrastructure, implemented comprehensive observability solutions, and worked with the team creating immersive demos using VR for visitors. My goal is to connect with fellow creatives, and continue expanding my knowledge across technology and creative fields while building experiences that can be enjoyed by many people.
