So, I have been telling myself that I would make a blog for years and always managed to procrastinate it. It probably didn't help that I convinced myself that I had to have some hand in making the blog rather than just using something ready like Medium or Substack, but here we are! 

I'm still not entirely sure what I'll end up writing about or where I'm going with this, but I'm hopeful that in a few years I'll have enough written that all these worries won't matter anymore.
