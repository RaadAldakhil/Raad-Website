...I watched so far. I decided that my inaugural post on my microblog should be something different than well-known "Hello World". In the past year I have been interested in Indian culture and trying to learn Hindi. Because of that I started watching Bollywood movies and I have to say I quite enjoy it. So in my first blog post I decided to share a list of some of my favourite movies I watched so far. The list contains only limited number of titles and I am planning on updating it later, but it should be enough for now. So here it goes:

* Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge,
* My Name Is Khan,
* Kal Ho Naa Ho,
* Kuch Kuch Hota Hai,
* Kabhi Khusi Kabhie Gham,
* Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi,
* Jab Tak Hai Jaan,
* Taare Zameen Par,
* 3 Idiots,
* Veer-Zaara,
* Yeh Jawaani Hai Deewani

So after an unusual start I promise the next blog post will be more technical and a bit longer, however it is not the last post related to India.
